This project provides a reproducible tutorial for performing phylogenetic analysis on linguistic data using **R**.
It includes methods like:

- Reading and visualising phylogenetic trees  
- Inferring trees using **Neighbor Joining**, **Maximum Parsimony**, and **Maximum Likelihood**

---

## üìÅ Files

- `index.Rmd`: Main tutorial notebook
- `data/cpacific.nex`: Example binary-coded linguistic dataset  
- `data/cpacific.mcct.trees: Tree file with posterior support values from Bayesian analysis.

---

## üõ† Requirements

To run this tutorial, you'll need:

- R (version ‚â• 4.1)
- R packages:
  - `ape`
  - `phytools`
  - `phangorn`
  - `ggplot2`

Install missing packages with:

```r
install.packages(c("ape", "phytools", "phangorn", "ggplot2"))
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Tutorial

- Open index.Rmd in RStudio or any RMarkdown-compatible environment.
- Work your way through the code.
- Explore the output: plots, trees, and results will be rendered inline.

You can also run this online using Binder (takes a little while to start):

## üåç Data Notes

cpacific.nex contains presence/absence data for cognates or typological features, in NEXUS format taken from 
the [Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database](https://abvd.eva.mpg.de/)

You can substitute this with your own data as long as it's formatted appropriately (NEXUS or aligned binary matrix).
